# Krazy-Cogs
A repository of my Custom Cogs for Red Discord Bot

Current cogs:
  * Wikisearch:
      Searches wikipedia for a users search terms or find a random page
      (Uses an internally modified version of the Wikipedia Python API to support Async).
  * Funny:
      Get a random funny webcomic.
  * Countdown:
      An Expansion on Repulser's Original Countdown cog.
      Now supports longer countdowns and uses synchronised UTC time so as to remain accurate to the second.
